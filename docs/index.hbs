<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This public REST API allows developers to create their own frontend instant messaging app.</p>

<p>You can check out the all the code that makes this possible on <a href="https://github.com/anteloalejandro/chat-server">GitHub</a>, and you are welcome to download, edit, distribute and fork this code however you want.</p>

<p>If you need an example implementation of a messaging app using this API, visit the <a href="https://github.com/anteloalejandro/chat-app">GitHub repo</a> of <a href="/">this app</a>.</p>

<h1 id="api">API Requests</h1>

<p>Responses from this API are all in JSON format.</p>

<p>This responses are categorized in 3 main object types: Users, Conversations and Messages, plus a set of different responses related to user authentication and other related to uploading files.</p>

<p>Most requests require a Query Parameter on the URL called 'token', which is used to identify a user. These requests will be marked with a ðŸ”’. This token is obtained when signing in as an already existing user (see the Auth responses for more info.)</p>

<p>If a request fails, instead of the response shown bellow, it will return an object with an "error" attribute detailing what happened.</p>

{{#each pages as |page|}}
{{#> section id=page heading=page }}
  {{> (concat 'content/' page) }}
{{/ section}}
{{/each}}

<h1 id="socketio">SocketIO Events</h1>

<p>In order to help with responsiveness, this server also provides developers with a set of SocketIO events.</p>

<p>These allow clients to comunicate inform each other when they send a message, start a new conversation, etc., removing the need to reload each time either of them want to see if something new has happened.</p>
